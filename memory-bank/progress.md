# Progress: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Current Status
✅ Memory bank initialization completed
✅ Core documentation framework established
✅ Codebase functionality assessment completed
✅ Comprehensive documentation created
✅ Development workflow establishment completed
✅ Feature implementation planning completed
✅ Project refactored to focus implementation
✅ Single command (list) fully implemented and enhanced
✅ Configuration system simplified to environment variables
✅ Build automation and version tracking implemented
✅ Documentation synchronized with implementation
✅ Memory bank files updated to reflect current reality

## What Works
- Project structure is well-organized following Go conventions
- Memory bank documentation system is in place
- Clear separation of concerns in directory structure
- Basic project context and goals are documented
- All core CRUD operations are fully functional
- Enhanced user experience with colored output and emojis
- Robust configuration management system
- Comprehensive API integration with both REST and GraphQL
- Built-in version tracking with detailed build metadata
- Version command for displaying application information
- Automated build process with version injection

## What's Left to Build
### Immediate Priorities
1. Establish development workflow and contribution guidelines
2. Add comprehensive testing coverage
3. Implement continuous integration
4. Create release automation

### Medium-term Goals
1. Enhance command functionality based on user needs
2. Improve error handling and user feedback
3. Add comprehensive testing coverage
4. Document usage examples and workflows
5. Add shell completion support
6. Implement batch operations

### Long-term Vision
1. Expand NetBox object type support
2. Add advanced filtering and search capabilities
3. Implement batch operations
4. Add export/import functionality
5. Add webhook/notification support
6. Create web-based companion interface

## Known Issues
- Test coverage is currently zero
- No continuous integration pipeline
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- No performance monitoring

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Established complete memory bank documentation system
- ✅ Created foundational project context documentation
- ✅ Defined system architecture patterns
- ✅ Documented technical context and constraints
- ✅ Fixed journal entry ID display issue in list command
- ✅ Enhanced list command output with colors, emojis, and improved formatting
- ✅ Added sorting functionality to display journal entries from newest to oldest
- ✅ Completed comprehensive code assessment
- ✅ Created detailed API documentation
- ✅ Developed complete developer guide
- ✅ Documented all existing functionality and architecture
- ✅ Added justfile for build automation and development workflow
- ✅ Updated justfile build commands to create statically linked binaries for better portability
- ✅ Implemented go-pretty library for enhanced table formatting in list command output
- ✅ Replaced manual ANSI color codes with go-pretty styling for better maintainability
- ✅ Improved output formatting with rounded table borders and professional appearance
- ✅ Removed unused `getColorForKind` function that was replaced with go-pretty styling
- ✅ **Constrained table width to 80 characters for better terminal compatibility** - Table output now automatically wraps long text and fits within standard terminal widths
- ✅ **Added horizontal line separators between all rows for improved visual separation and readability**
- ✅ **Removed unused command implementations (create, read, update, delete, device) - only list command remains as it's the only implemented verb**
- ✅ **Modified configuration loading to use environment variables only (`nbjrnlctl_base_url` and `nbjrnlctl_api_key`) instead of file-based configuration for better server deployment support**
- ✅ **Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated build and test on push to main branch with cross-platform binary builds**

## Next Milestones
1. Add automated testing infrastructure
2. Implement continuous integration
3. Plan next feature enhancements
4. Establish release process automation
