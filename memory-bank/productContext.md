# Product Context: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Problem Statement
Infrastructure teams using NetBox often need to document changes, maintenance activities, and operational notes. Currently, this process involves manual web interface interactions or complex API scripting, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution Value
nb-jrnl-ctl provides a specialized command-line interface that streamlines journal entry management in NetBox, enabling faster documentation of infrastructure changes while maintaining consistency and reducing human error.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive command structure that mirrors common CRUD operations
- Minimal configuration required for basic operations
- Clear error messages and help documentation
- Consistent output formatting for script integration
- Device-centric workflow for common use cases

## Core Workflows
1. **Quick Journal Creation**: Users can rapidly create new journal entries with minimal parameters
2. **Journal Review**: Users can list and read existing journal entries for devices or globally
3. **Journal Updates**: Users can modify existing journal entries when corrections are needed
4. **Journal Cleanup**: Users can delete obsolete or incorrect journal entries

## Success Scenarios
- Network administrator documents a router configuration change in under 30 seconds
- DevOps engineer automates journal entry creation as part of deployment scripts
- Infrastructure team reviews all journal entries for a device during troubleshooting
- Operations manager generates reports from journal data through command output parsing

## Non-Goals
- Full NetBox administration interface
- Complex journal entry formatting or rich text support
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced search and filtering beyond basic listing capabilities

## Integration Requirements
- Seamless authentication with existing NetBox instances
- Compatibility with NetBox API versioning
- Proper handling of NetBox data models and relationships
- Respect for NetBox rate limiting and API best practices
