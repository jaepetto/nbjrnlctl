# Project Brief: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Project Overview
nb-jrnl-ctl is a Go-based command-line tool for reviewing journal entries, specifically designed to work with NetBox (an IP address management and data center infrastructure management tool). The tool provides an enhanced listing interface for journal entries through a focused command interface.

## Core Purpose
To provide a streamlined CLI interface for reviewing journal entries in NetBox, making infrastructure documentation and change tracking more accessible through command-line automation with enhanced formatting and usability.

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for journal entry review
- Integration with NetBox API (REST and GraphQL)
- Enhanced list journal entries for devices with colored output and emojis
- Device-specific journal operations with automatic hostname detection
- Environment variable-based configuration management
- Built-in version tracking and build metadata

## Target Audience
Network administrators, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure teams who use NetBox for infrastructure management and need efficient ways to review changes and maintain journals through command-line automation.

## Success Metrics
- Reliable integration with NetBox API
- Intuitive command structure
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy environment variable-based configuration
- Enhanced user experience with formatted output

## Project Scope
This tool focuses specifically on journal entry review within NetBox, providing a specialized interface for reading and displaying journal entries with enhanced formatting rather than attempting to cover all NetBox functionality.

## Constraints
- Must work with existing NetBox installations
- Should handle various authentication methods
- Need to support different NetBox API versions
- Must be cross-platform compatible
- Focus on read-only operations for stability and security
