# Project Brief: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Project Overview
nb-jrnl-ctl is a Go-based command-line tool for managing journal entries, specifically designed to work with NetBox (an IP address management and data center infrastructure management tool). The tool provides CRUD operations for journal entries through a structured command interface.

## Core Purpose
To provide a streamlined CLI interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting journal entries in NetBox, making infrastructure documentation and change tracking more accessible through command-line automation.

## Key Features
- Command-line interface for journal management
- Integration with NetBox API
- List journal entries for devices
- Device-specific journal operations
- Configuration management utilities

## Target Audience
Network administrators, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure teams who use NetBox for infrastructure management and need efficient ways to document changes and maintain journals through command-line automation.

## Success Metrics
- Reliable integration with NetBox API
- Intuitive command structure
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy configuration management

## Project Scope
This tool focuses specifically on journal entry management within NetBox, providing a specialized interface rather than attempting to cover all NetBox functionality.

## Constraints
- Must work with existing NetBox installations
- Should handle various authentication methods
- Need to support different NetBox API versions
- Must be cross-platform compatible
