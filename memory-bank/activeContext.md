# Active Context: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Current Focus
Project initialization and memory bank establishment. This represents the foundational setup phase where core documentation is being created to support future development and maintenance activities.

## Recent Changes
- Project brief documentation created
- Product context established
- System architecture patterns documented
- Technical context captured
- Active context initialized
- Fixed journal entry ID display issue in list command
- Fixed journal entry 'kind' column population by extracting from GraphQL 'display' field
- Improved 'kind' extraction logic to handle NetBox's specific display format with parentheses
- Enhanced list command output formatting with colors, emojis, and improved layout
- Added sorting functionality to display journal entries from newest to oldest

## Next Steps
- Create progress tracking documentation
- Review existing codebase structure
- Identify immediate development priorities
- Establish development workflow patterns
- Document any existing functionality discoveries

## Active Decisions
- Using Go as the primary development language
- Following standard Go project structure conventions
- Implementing layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Focusing on NetBox journal entry management as the core use case
- Prioritizing CLI usability and API integration reliability

## Key Considerations
- Need to understand existing codebase functionality before making changes
- Should maintain backward compatibility with NetBox API standards
- Must ensure secure handling of API credentials
- Should establish clear documentation patterns for future development
- Need to consider extensibility for additional NetBox object types

## Learning Points
- Project uses internal/ directory structure for private packages
- Commands are organized by operation rather than object type
- Client pattern is used for API interactions
- Configuration management utilities are centralized
- Error handling strategies need to be consistent across layers

## Current Questions
- What is the current state of implementation for each command?
- Are there any existing tests or testing patterns?
- What NetBox API version is currently supported?
- Are there any known issues or limitations in the current implementation?
