# Active Context: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Current Focus
Code assessment and documentation completion. This represents the phase where we're analyzing the existing codebase and creating comprehensive documentation to support future development and maintenance activities.

## Recent Changes
- Project brief documentation created
- Product context established
- System architecture patterns documented
- Technical context captured
- Active context initialized
- Fixed journal entry ID display issue in list command
- Fixed journal entry 'kind' column population by extracting from GraphQL 'display' field
- Improved 'kind' extraction logic to handle NetBox's specific display format with parentheses
- Enhanced list command output formatting with colors, emojis, and improved layout
- Added sorting functionality to display journal entries from newest to oldest
- Completed comprehensive code assessment and documentation
- Created detailed API documentation
- Developed developer guide and best practices
- Added justfile for build automation and development workflow
- Updated justfile build commands to create statically linked binaries for better portability
- Implemented go-pretty library for enhanced table formatting in list command output
- Replaced manual ANSI color codes with go-pretty styling for better maintainability
- Improved output formatting with rounded table borders and professional appearance
- Removed unused `getColorForKind` function that was replaced with go-pretty styling
- **Constrained table width to 80 characters for better terminal compatibility** - Table output now automatically wraps long text and fits within standard terminal widths
- **Added horizontal line separators between all rows for improved visual separation and readability**

## Next Steps
- Review and validate all created documentation
- Identify areas for future enhancement and testing
- Establish development workflow patterns
- Plan next feature implementations

## Active Decisions
- Using Go as the primary development language
- Following standard Go project structure conventions
- Implementing layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Focusing on NetBox journal entry management as the core use case
- Prioritizing CLI usability and API integration reliability
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation as a core project value

## Key Considerations
- Need to understand existing codebase functionality before making changes
- Should maintain backward compatibility with NetBox API standards
- Must ensure secure handling of API credentials
- Should establish clear documentation patterns for future development
- Need to consider extensibility for additional NetBox object types
- Testing infrastructure needs to be established

## Learning Points
- Project uses internal/ directory structure for private packages
- Commands are organized by operation rather than by entity
- Client pattern is used for API interactions
- Configuration management utilities are centralized
- Error handling strategies need to be consistent across layers
- GraphQL integration provides rich data fetching capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation is essential for project maintainability

## Current Questions
- What areas need immediate testing infrastructure?
- Are there any performance optimizations that should be prioritized?
