# Active Context: nb-jrnl-ctl

## Current Focus
Documentation review and synchronization. Ensuring all memory-bank files and documentation accurately reflect the current state of the codebase after recent refactoring and simplification.

## Recent Changes
Based on git history, the following significant changes have been made:
- **Removed unused verb commands** - Only the list command remains as it's the only implemented verb
- **Modified configuration loading** - Now uses environment variables only (`nbjrnlctl_base_url` and `nbjrnlctl_api_key`) instead of file-based configuration
- **Enhanced list command output** - Added width constraints and horizontal separators for better terminal compatibility
- **Refactored list command output** - Now uses go-pretty library for enhanced formatting and maintainability
- **Removed unused `getColorForKind` function** - Replaced with go-pretty styling
- **Implemented version tracking system** - With compile-time version injection
- **Added version command** - To display detailed build metadata
- **Updated build processes** - To embed version information using ldflags
- **Updated justfile** - For build automation and development workflow
- **Constrained table width** - To 80 characters for better terminal compatibility
- **Added horizontal line separators** - Between all rows for improved visual separation and readability

## Next Steps
- Update all documentation files to accurately reflect current implementation
- Ensure memory-bank files are synchronized with actual codebase state
- Identify any remaining discrepancies between documentation and implementation
- Create a comprehensive review report

## Active Decisions
- Simplified command structure to only include implemented functionality
- Using environment variables exclusively for configuration
- Focusing on a single, well-implemented command (list) rather than incomplete features
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation as a core project value
- Using modern Go practices and libraries (go-pretty for formatting)

## Key Considerations
- Documentation must accurately reflect the current single-command implementation
- Memory-bank files should describe the actual current state, not historical plans
- All references to removed commands must be eliminated from documentation
- Configuration documentation must reflect environment-variable-only approach
- Version tracking documentation must be accurate and complete

## Learning Points
- Project has been significantly simplified to focus on working functionality
- Documentation drift is a real issue that needs regular attention
- Git history shows the evolution from ambitious plans to focused implementation
- Clean architecture principles are still maintained despite simplification
- Modern libraries (go-pretty) improve code quality and maintainability

## Current Questions
- Are all documentation references to removed commands properly eliminated?
- Does the memory-bank accurately reflect the current single-command reality?
- Is the configuration documentation up-to-date with environment-variable-only approach?
