- Keep project files between 300-500 lines where possible.
- Don't duplicate code; build upon existing implementations.

- all changes should be documented into a CHANGELOG file
- all changes should also be documented into Cline's memory bank
- all new code should contain a comment at the top of the file with the date and a short description of what was changed
- all new code should contain comments explaining the why and not the what
